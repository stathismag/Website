### Episode 1

**Briefing Doc**: The Effect of Proximity to Political Power on Corporate Cash Policy

**Source**: Magerakis, E., Pantzalis, C., & Park, J. C. (2023). The effect of proximity to political power on corporate cash policy. [Journal of Corporate Finance, 82, 102448](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0929119923000974).

**Main Theme**: This study examines how a firm's proximity to political power, specifically its location within the US political landscape, influences its cash holding decisions. The authors argue that firms headquartered in states with a higher degree of political alignment with the President's party face elevated policy risk, leading them to adopt more conservative cash policies as a hedging mechanism.
