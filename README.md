# [Website](https://github.com/stathismag/Website)

As of April 2019, I started from a clean version of Hugo Academic [Hugo Academic Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) to design my Personal Academic [Website](https://www.smagerakis.gr).

I have set up [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), a **static website generator** using the quick start guide. 

Please refer to George Cushen's [Hugo Academic theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic), which is what this site is based upon, and Flip Tanedo's  [Academic-Flip](https://github.com/fliptanedo/academic-flip), a side project that aims to propose features for Cushen's theme, from which several modifications where adopted.
